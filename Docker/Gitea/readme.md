# :tea: Gitea 
[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) is a Self Hosted Git Repo Manager. It is similar to GitHub and GitLab, but is lightweight enough to be ran on even a simple Raspberry Pi! 

In this Folder you will find the docker-compose file, and .env files to configure the containers. The compose file creates 2 containers, one is the mySQL database used to store the Gitea data, and the second is the Gitea container itself. 

For detailed instruction on how to install and use this template, please visit my post at https://www.aaronslab.ca or the official documentation [here](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-with-docker/).
